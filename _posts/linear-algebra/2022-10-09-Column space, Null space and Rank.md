> Column space of matrix $$A$$

Span of matrix $$A$$'s column vectors. \\
Intuitively, it can also be seen as **span of _changed basis_**, because $$A$$ changes the $$i'th $$ basis into it's $$i'th$$ column.

> Null space(kernel) of matrix $$A$$

Linear subspace of the domain of the map which is mapped to the zero vector. \\
As $$A$$ can be seen as linear transformation, vector in $$A$$'s nullspace squeezes to zero when transformed by $$A$$.

> Rank of matrix $$A$$

The definition of rank is the dimension of vectorspace generated by columns of $$A$$. \\
Intuitively, if $$A$$ squeezes $$m$$-dimensional space into $$n$$-dimensional space, $$n$$ is the rank of $$A$$
