**What is an AMM?**

AMM allows traders to buy and sell certain coins using an algorithm that dictates how expensive something should be, based on how much of it. Simply, it's a supply & demand based on algorithm.

$$X \times Y = k$$

X and Y being the number of tokens in the liquidity pool, there product remains the same.

Suppose there are 50,000 token X and Y are present in a liquidity pool. If you sell 7,000 X token to the liquidity pool, then you get 6140 Y token, Because

$$ (50,000+7,000) \times (50,000 - 6,140) \approx 50,000 \times 50,000 $$
